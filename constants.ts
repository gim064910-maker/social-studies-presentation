    title: 'The AI Paradox: Convenience vs. Dependency',
    subtitle: 'The AI Ecosystem and the Future of Human Intelligence',
    body: "Hi, my name is Noah Kim.\nToday, I want to look beyond the convenience of the free AI tools we use every day.\n\nWe often see AI as something that simply makes our lives easier. But behind that convenience, there is a hidden cost. Specifically, I want to explore how these “free” services may be weakening our cognitive independence and pushing us toward a future where human labor becomes less valuable—or even unnecessary.\n\nSo the question is:\nAre we truly mastering this technology, or are we slowly being shaped by it?\nLet’s find out.",

    body: "ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude—these tools have become part of our daily lives. We use them to help with homework, write code, summarize information, and answer questions almost instantly.\n\nIt often feels like having a super-intelligent assistant that works for us for free. But this raises an important question. In a capitalist system driven by profit, why would some of the most powerful technologies in the world be available at no cost?",

    subtitle: 'The Hidden Exchange Behind “Free” Services',
    body: "There is a common saying: there is no such thing as a free lunch.\nTechnology companies are not charities. They are not spending billions of dollars simply out of generosity.\n\nIf these companies were only losing money, they would not survive. Instead, they continue to invest even more into AI. The reason is simple: we are not just users—we are contributors.\n\nEvery interaction we have with AI helps generate massive amounts of data. Data that these companies would otherwise need to pay enormous amounts of money to collect. In this system, we are not paying with cash, but with something far more valuable: our behavior, our feedback, and our time.",

    subtitle: 'User or Unpaid Laborer?',
    body: "You might ask, “Is my data really that valuable?”\nThe answer is yes.\n\nFirst, consider the idea of “unpaid labor.” Every time we correct an AI, give feedback, or improve its responses, we are helping train the system—doing work that would normally require paid experts.\n\nSecond, unlike money, data does not disappear when it is spent. It accumulates over time. As AI systems learn from more data, they become stronger, creating an advantage that money alone cannot easily buy.\n\nIn this way, we are investing our time and effort to help these companies gain long-term influence over the digital systems that will shape our future.",

    subtitle: 'Can We Return to a Life Without AI?',
    body: "The data we provide is building something much bigger than a simple chatbot. It is powering the next wave of technology—physical robots, autonomous vehicles, and advanced drones.\n\nAt the same time, we are becoming increasingly dependent on AI assistance. In areas like coding and writing, AI can already outperform many humans. If these services suddenly became paid tomorrow, would we stop using them? Probably not.\n\nAs AI continues to replace professional roles—such as the medical and technical jobs some industry leaders predict—this dependence may no longer feel optional. For many people, adapting to AI may become a necessity rather than a choice.",

    title: 'Outsourcing Intelligence',
    subtitle: 'The Cognitive Cost of Convenience',
    body: "The greatest danger of AI is not automation alone—it is the outsourcing of thinking itself. When we allow AI to write our essays or solve problems for us, our brains do less of the work.\n\nLearning requires struggle. That struggle strengthens our cognitive abilities and builds deep understanding. When we skip it, we lose opportunities to develop critical thinking and creativity.\n\nOver time, this can weaken our mental flexibility. We risk becoming good at consuming answers, but poor at generating ideas. In exchange for short-term convenience, we may be giving up long-term intellectual strength.",

    subtitle: 'From Digital Intelligence to Physical Labor',
    body: "What we see on our screens today is only the beginning. AI is no longer limited to the digital world. The same intelligence trained on our data is now being applied to machines, robots, and autonomous systems.\n\nThis shift has serious consequences for human labor. We are not just training chatbots—we are contributing to systems that can perform physical and cognitive work without human involvement.\n\nThe irony is clear: the data we freely provided to improve AI systems is now helping create technologies that compete directly with human workers.",

    subtitle: 'Choosing Control Over Convenience',
    body: "My main argument is simple: the convenience of “free” AI tools comes with a trade-off. In exchange for ease today, we risk losing agency tomorrow.\n\nIf we rely on AI uncritically, we become dependent providers of data. But if we use these tools carefully—as assistants rather than replacements—we can maintain control over our thinking and decisions.\n\nThere is no free lunch. The real cost of convenience is technological sovereignty. Whether we remain passive users or become active masters of technology is a choice we still have.\n\nThis concludes my presentation on The Value of Data and Technological Dependency.\nThank you for listening, and I hope this encourages you to think more critically about the tools you use every day.",
